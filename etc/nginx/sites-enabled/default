# This file will automatically load configuration files provided by other

## Configuration with SSL (https://).
## Replace YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME with your domain name (e.g., example.com).
## Replace PATH_TO_YOUR_CERTIFICATE and PATH_TO_YOUR_SECRET_KEY with the
## full path to your SSL certificate and key. For instance, if you saved
## them in /root/.ssl/ you would have: /root/.ssl/certificate.crt.
## Don't forget the semicolon to terminate each line!
